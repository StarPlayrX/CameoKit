# CameoKit
HTTP Live Streaming Engine, SXM middleware and framework that I wrote for StarPlayrX.

Does the heavy lifting for StarPlayrX 1.0 - 1.2.9

CameoKit which runs on Perfect 4 by Perfectly Soft is now deprecated. StarPlayrX 1.3.0 and later will use a new and improved middleware that's easier to compile and its binary will be 1/2 to 1/3 the original size.

It's replacement framework is on going and is currently being dubbed staRadioKit, name subject to change and is currently within StarPlayrX_iOS's 1.3.0 branch.

For http m3u8 embedded streaming 1.3.0 uses a slimmed down fork of Swifter called Swifter Embedded Lite, name subject change.
